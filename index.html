                <b>My name is Fernando Kok. I live in Venray with my mother and my cat. I am a 17 year old software developer student at Sint Lucas.  I was born in 2004 on the 25th of December. <br>I want to become a software developer to create the games I play and love. In my free time I play games but I don’t let that get in the way of my work. Eventually I want to work at one of the big gaming companies such as riot games, epic games etc. Right now I know how to work in unity and have made a couple of games of which you can see under the projects tab on my portfolio website. All of the games I made with unity I have done using c# in visual studio. I know how to create a database and have experience with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am a very silent person who listens more than he speaks. I don’t get stressed easily and am a very calm person who doesn’t let their emotion control his actions and way of thinking. 
                <br><h2>Why me?</h2>I think you should hire me because I put all my effort into my work and can work well alone and with a team. I try to not let my personal stuff interfere with my work and always hand in my work way before the deadline.</b>

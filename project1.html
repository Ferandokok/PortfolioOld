            <h2>Hardcore parkour</h2>
            This game was my first game that I had free choices in. a lot of the code I had to search up but the layout and design I did myself. Iâ€™ve created a game where you can jump from platform to platform and when you touch a red coloured object you die. I added purple teleport pads so when you touch them you teleport to a different location. There are a total of three levels. I added a finish line and a main menu where you can select which level you want to play. 
            Making this game really helped me grasp on how game really are put together and how they work. It also helped me know to properly structure my code and mapping to make it clearer for myself and perhaps others when I need to do group projects.
